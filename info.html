        <h2>Super Smash Bros. Tier List Maker</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <div class="games">
                <p>In gaming, a tier list is a list that ranks all characters in a game based on the strength of their fighting abilities, as well as their potential to win matches under tournament conditions, assuming players are of equal skill.</p>
                <h4 class="games" id="smash64">Super Smash Bros. 64</h4>
                <p>Super Smash Bros. (unofficially known as Super Smash Bros. 64) is a crossover fighting video game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The first game in the Super Smash Bros. series, it is a crossover between several different Nintendo franchises, including Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Metroid, F-Zero, Mother, Kirby, and Pok√©mon. It presents a cast of characters and locations from these franchises and allows players to use each character's unique skills and the stage's hazards to inflict damage, recover health, and ultimately knock opponents off the stage.

                <h4 class="games" id="melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</h4>
                <p>Melee includes all playable characters from the first game, and also adds characters from franchises such as Fire Emblem, of which no games had been released outside Japan at the time. Melee's gameplay system offers an unorthodox approach to the fighting game genre, with a counter that measures damage with increasing percentages, representing the knockback the character will experience, rather than a depleting health bar seen in most fighting games. It builds on the first game by adding new gameplay features and playable characters. Following the popularity of its multiplayer gameplay, Melee has been featured in many competitive gaming tournaments, and is one of the most popular competitive fighting games.

            <div class="tiers">
                <h4 id="toptier">Top Tier</h4>
                <div class="tiers">
                    <p>Top Tier is reserved for the best characters in the game that have little to no flaws and hardly any bad matchups. They're usually the characters that dish out the most damage through combos and get the best tournament results.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4 id="hightier">High Tier</h4>
                <div class="tiers">
                    <p>High Tier is usually made up of characters who have a defined role or niche that keeps them relevant in the metagame, but they may have some sort of flaw that holds them back from being top tier. That said, they're still powerful characters that make great secondaries but shouldn't be used as solos.

                </div>
                <h4 id="midtier">Mid Tier</h4>
                <div class="tiers">
                    <p>Mid Tier characters can still have a place in the metagame, but have flaws that keep them from being great as primaries. They might be highly matchup dependent, or have a trait like weight or small hitboxes that keeps them from being more potent. They could also have a higher skillcap than high or top tiers. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4 id="lowtier">Low Tier</h4>
                <div class="tiers">
                    <p>Low Tiers are, for the most part, not going to be all that viable in the Smash Bros. metagame. They have majors flaws or are outclassed entirely by other characters in the game. Aside from very niche scenarios, there's not much reason to play these characters in a tournament setting.</p>
